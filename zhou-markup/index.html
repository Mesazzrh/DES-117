                <h2>Project 4 - Event Poster</h2>
                <p>This project was about creating a event poster for a event that either had already passed or creating a whole new event with, title of the event, basic information about the event, location, dates, and time. Then search photos on the web to be implemented using Adobe Photoshop. The event I chose for this project was the Chinatown Autumn Moon Festival that had happened in 2023 in San Francisco's Chinatown.</p>
